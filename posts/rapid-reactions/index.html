                        <div class="post-date">15 Apr. 2015</div>
                        <p>It's been almost two months since my last post. What have I been up to?</p>
                        <p>The months of February and March are largely a blur. I'm sure when April is finished, it too will have been a blur. Penning the experiences of my final semester of undergraduate studies would be a massive undertaking, so instead I want to discuss some key sections of my research, some problems I faced, and my reflections on the work I produced. Here are some of my rapid reactions to finishing my thesis:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>A senior Honors Thesis is a hefty undertaking in context of finishing classes, social pressures, and of course - figuring out what the hell you're planning on doing with the rest of your life. I spent countless nights tucked away in some corner of Davis Library, hunched over my laptop, tapping out lines of code for some graph or scratching my head thinking <i>man, this paragraph I wrote sounds awfully repetitive.</i> I also found myself ditching other work to tinker with the data. My thesis became somewhat of an obsession and I easily spent between 20-30 hours a week working on it.</p></li>
                            <li><p>It's better to have a complete body of work that is not perfect than not have a completed body of work at all. Finishing something, whether it was finally setting up a well-functioning coding environment, a section of a paper, or a presentation, is vital to the next step in the research process...</p></li>
                            <li><p>...which is editing. I love editing. Taking a red pen to something I finished is a magical feeling. Tweaking, crafting, rewording, <i>refining</i> bodies of work is so incredibly important to finding your voice. I talk to so many of my peers and hear they often turn in completely raw, unedited first drafts of papers of sizable length. I can't help but cringe.</p></li>
                            <li><p>By the same token, no body of work can ever be 100% perfect. I've learned over my past four years of college that no program, no paper, no assignment that has any sort of subjective component to it, can ever be 100% perfect. I could sit and rewrite my thesis for weeks, but at some point I have to stop myself and say, <i>I've done all I can, and I am satisfied with this result.</i> This doesn't necessarily mean you have to settle for less, it just means you can't beat yourself up over the process. At some point you have to deliver a product. As my roommate says, <i>It has to go 1.0 sometime.</i></p></li>
                            <li><p>Massaging data isn't always easy. I find sample data (see <a href="../hack-night/">Hack Night Demo</a>) all the time with no holes or NaNs and nice, neat columns. In reality, data can be messy. One of the biggest challenges I faced at the start of joining the net-score project was taking seven months of data and combining and storing it into a single place. Luckily, I found <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> which single handedly enabled my work to go so much smoother. I first started out by concatenating CSV files using <code>cat</code> and piping the output to a new file. After wanting to pull my hair out for an admittedly longer period of time than necessary, and taking winter break to mess with pandas, I managed to neatly combine all of our data into a single DataFrame.</p></li>
                            <li><p>An Honors Thesis is a great first foray into academic research. I learned how to handle the amount of freedom researchers are given. Asking and answering questions are up to the individual, and I found myself with the ability to steer the project in whatever direction I wished. However, having a mentor to guide my thought process helped me the most.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the coming weeks, I hope to publish parts of my thesis on this website. I have a lot of great plots, charts, and maps that really dive and provide insights into the data that the net-score project collected over a short deployment. Stay tuned!</p>
