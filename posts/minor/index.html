                        <h3>The benefits of an undergraduate minor</h3>
                        <div class="post-date">25 Jul. 2015</div>
                        <p>It's easy to get wrapped up in science and math courses when pursuing an undergraduate degree. With our nation's, and North Carolina's, obsession with STEM, the myriad of fantastic liberal arts courses often go overlooked. Luckily, UNC offered many liberal arts courses that were not only interesting, but were taught by renowned researchers and expert faculty in their fields. When I gave tours, I liked to preach the benefits of general education courses, even though most of my classmates griped about struggling in "useless classes." Maybe I'm a hopeless academic, but I truly enjoyed taking courses in world history, comparative literature, jazz music, bioethics, and introductory economics.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, taking courses outside of a science major in pursuit of a minor (or certificate) has three main benefits:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Improved breadth of study and exposure to new fields</li>
                                <li>Improved appreciation for other fields, especially in the humanities</li>
                                <li>Improved skills and value within dominant (scientific) area of study</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>In what follows, I will provide brief support for each of these claims with personal anecdotes and experience.</p>
                        <h4>Breadth of study</h4>
                        <p>Considering the fact that graduate school forces further specialization, I believe that undergraduates should aim to increase the breadth of their studies, especially into the liberal arts. In my time as an undergraduate, I chose to minor in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE), a five course joint program with Duke University. In this program, I took a course in each of the three disciplines, framed by a "Gateway" course and cumulating in a "Capstone" course. The Gateway course gave us an introduction how each of the three disciplines are intertwined and the Capstone course was taken after all other courses had been completed. By adopting this minor, I was introduced to authors and philosophers in modern schools of thought, quite frequently in my backyard of Chapel Hill and Durham. Furthermore, class discussions, though pedantic at times, brought together students of drastically different backgrounds. I found it often refreshing to converse rather than to absorb.</p>
                        <h4>Appreciation</h4>
                        <p>Einstein's famous quote "the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know" summarizes my thoughts as I leave undergraduate studies. Computer science is not the only field with broad applications and specializations. After studying PPE, I noticed that each field I've taken a course in has similar depth and breadth. I've developed a greater appreciation for students of all disciplines. Mixing with students in different majors by taking classes towards a minor is a great way to practice empathy.</p>
                        <h4>Increasing personal value</h4>
                        <p>From personal experience, I found that writing philosophy papers helped me write technical papers in computer science. Having to motivate goals, present background and current state-of-the-art, detail experimentation, and succinctly summarize conclusions are skills common to both fields. I found that over my second semester senior year, my writing skills in both domains greatly improved in parallel. Furthermore, critical reading and writing skills are vital to any field. Presenting these thoughts in front of classmates who are also charged with thinking critically is great practice for developing communication skills needed in the workplace.</p>
                        <h4>Parting thoughts</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Break out of your comfort zone - take liberal arts classes</li>
                            <li>Attend shows in the performing arts and support your friends who study in those fields</li>
                            <li>Focus on connecting the course material you encounter outside your major with course material within your major</li>
                        </ol>
