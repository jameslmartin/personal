                <h3>The benefits of an undergraduate minor</h3>
                <div class="post-date">25 Jul. 2015</div>
                <p>It's easy to get wrapped up in science and math courses when pursuing an undergraduate degree. With our nation's, and North Carolina's, obsession with STEM, the myriad of fantastic liberal arts courses often go overlooked. Luckily, UNC offered many liberal arts courses that were not only interesting, but were taught by renowned researchers and expert faculty in their fields. When I gave tours, I liked to preach the benefits of general education courses, even though most of my classmates griped about struggling in "useless classes." Maybe I'm a hopeless academic, but I truly enjoyed taking courses in world history, comparative literature, jazz music, bioethics, and introductory economics.</p>
                <p>In my opinion, taking courses outside of a science major in pursuit of a minor (or certificate) has three main benefits:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Improved breadth of study and exposure to new fields</li>
                        <li>Improved appreciation for other fields, especially in the humanities</li>
                        <li>Improved skills and value within dominant (scientific) area of study</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>In what follows, I will provide brief support for each of these claims with personal anecdotes and experience.</p>

                <h3>Microptimizations</h3>
                <div class="post-date">28 Jun. 2015</div>
                <p>I very much enjoy browsing other developer's blogs and personal websites to absorb as much information as I can. I know I'm a long way from being a great developer so I always look for interesting and easy ways to improve and sharpen my skills. Since starting as an Extreme Blue intern, I've had much greater flexibility when it comes to coding style.</p>
                <p>I see this as a blessing <i>and</i> a curse. Criticism and editing are vital components of the writing process (as I noted in my <a href="../posts/rapid-reactions/" target="_blank">rapid reactions</a> to finishing my thesis) and I believe they are also vital aspects to the development process. As a software developer, I firmly believe no code is perfect after a first pass. I often note methods and classes for revision and search for ways to tweak and tune my code to be faster or more readable. </p>
                <p>I came across a well maintained site of a C++ developer by the name of Constantine Tarasenkov. The UI of the <a href="http://www.procedural.github.io" target="_blank">website</a> was very clean so I stuck around and came across <a href="https://procedural.github.io//Chandler-Carruth-and-Mike-Acton-on-Efficiency-and-Performance-of-C++-Code/" target="_blank">this post</a>, which featured a few videos from CppCon 2014. Though my C++ chops are far from professional, I nonetheless watched a good portion of the first video. The most useful advice I took away came around <a href="https://youtu.be/fHNmRkzxHWs?t=26m" target="_blank">26 minutes</a>, where Chandler points out the very simple idea of only making one call to retrieve the value of the cache once. This was a forehead-smacking moment for me.</p>

                <p>My research in the computer science department at UNC consisted of conducting a series of experiments to evaluate whether the net-score tool accomplished its goals of being a scalable, low-cost method of measuring broadband performance.</p>

                <div class="post-date">18 Feb. 2015</div>
                <p>On February 18th, I gave a presentation about security vulnerabilities in modern automotive vehicles. The presentation was for a graduate level course led by <a href='http://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/'>Jim Anderson</a> on autonomous automotive vehicles. I performed some first-pass research on vulnerabilities that modern cars face, today. Synthesizing the information, I created a presentation that summarized my findings. Here are some highlights.</p>

                <h3>Field notes on cleaning up URLs</h3>
                <div class="post-date">15 Feb. 2015</div>
                <p>So today I wanted to set to cleaning up the URLs for the site. This is a super simple hack, does not take long to complete, and makes your URLs much prettier. My roommate, Chris Hendel (<a href="https://twitter.com/chris_hendel">@chris_hendel</a>), does professional web development for <a href="https://getpebble.com/">Pebble</a>. We discuss quality design in web development quite frequently, and while he is much better than I am with it, we discuss the latest tools and frameworks often. I asked him how to change my code so that the filenames do not appear at the end of my URLs, and he told me this is all you have to do.</p>

                <div class="post-date">29 Jan. 2015</div>
                <p>On Thursday, January 29th, I gave a short demo at UNC Chapel Hill at the CS club's Hack Night about using IPython Notebook and Pandas to do quick data analysis. I looked at some sample data from <a href="http://www.ookla.com/netmetrics">Ookla's Netmetrics</a> product. Afterwards, I answered questions and chatted with interested undergraduates. This post was entirely made with IPython Notebook.</p>
